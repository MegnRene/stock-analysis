# Stock-Analysis

## 2018 

First starting with DQ,  I found the total daily volume and yearly returns for each stock. Found that DQ traded 107, 873, 900 shares in 2018 but the yearly return was -62.60%. Which concluded that it was not a good idea for his parents to invest in DQ. I found that in 2018 ENPH and RUN were the only ones that had a positive return.

In 2017 DQ had the highest return percentage. With TERP having the only negative return for that year.
